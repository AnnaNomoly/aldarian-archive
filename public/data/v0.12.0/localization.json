Let's see...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/3":"Balor enjoys his luxuries far too much, so he wouldn't last a day. Eiland, too.

But I wouldn't say either is my first pick.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/5":"Holt would simply perish if he didn't have someone else to hear his jokes.

Have you seen that man's legs in a bathing suit?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/2":"March would run through all his energy trying to jump higher than the other frogs.

He seems the type to be content with the simple life.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/4":"He's a city boy, Juniper.

One of those poisonous ones.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/9":"Besides, we all know the real answer. It has to be Errol! Have you seen that man's legs in a bathing suit?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/init":"Ahoy there, [Ari]! Help me answer Juniper's strange question.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/1":"You wouldn't happen to know why, would you?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/2":"Ah, I can tell by your expression that I shouldn't pursue the matter further.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/init":"[Ari], I couldn't help but notice that Terithia and Juniper were both pointing at me the other night.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/1":"Who here would make the best pirate?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/2":"Oho, I was born to answer this question. Errol would look dashing with a tricorn hat, but he gets a tad seasick. Hemlock strikes me as a right salty dog.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/3":"And Nora would make a fearful captain, but a fair one. Oh, it's difficult to choose!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/4":"March has that look in his eye that says everyone is his enemy. He might even pull off an eyepatch.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5":"What do you think, [Ari]?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5/prompts/0":"Dell, Maple and Luc! They play pirates all the time.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5/prompts/1":"Elsie! She'd plunder everyone's hearts!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/6":"I have to throw in with [Ari] on this one, Terithia. They're half pirate already!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/7":"Mistria's original rapscallions.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/8":"She does have a heart of adventure.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/9":"She'd be the siren of the sea! No one could resist her charms.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/init":"Now Terithia, I've put a lot of thought into this question, so I hope you'll take it seriously.

Bet he could.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/11":"I can see it. She has a curious mind, and an eye for herbs, which are two of the basic tenets of potion-making.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/12":"But I frankly don't think she could pull off the wardrobe.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/13":"Hmm. Bet she could.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/2":"Of course, of course. But Terithia, we proposed starting a pirate crew last week! Work with me here.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/3":"Fair enough. Let's see now, Eiland's read a lot of old books about the Witch Queens... but I'd say that's where his interest ends.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/4":"March has a knack for creating things, but he's a bit rigid otherwise.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/5":"Josephine does give me pause. She has a way of moving through the world.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/6":"What about Valen?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7":"I won't even dignify that with a response. [Ari], speak up! Your thoughts are wanted. And no picking yourself!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7/prompts/0":"Hayden! Henrietta is like his familiar!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7/prompts/1":"Celine! The way her flowers bloom is magical!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/8":"Interesting. And I do see it. He has a strong connection to his animals, and a connection to the land as well.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/9":"But I frankly don't think he could pull off the wardrobe.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/init":"My, look at all those people down there. We've got a full house. I wonder which of them would make the best sorcerer?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_celine/1":"I think she agreed a little too quickly, though!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_celine/init":"Juniper asked if I wanted her old hand-me-downs. I told her thank you, but they're not really my style...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_hayden/1":"When I asked if she wanted to be MY assistant, she looked like she might faint! Well, I doubt she has the shoes for it anyway.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_hayden/init":"Juniper asked if I wanted to become her assistant! I said no, of course, I'm too busy with the farm.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/1":"Yaaaay!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/2":"A perfect place to introduce ourselves. I'm the scholar Aram, here to research the architectural secrets of the world!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/3":"Keeping it true to life, cool. I'm a birdwatcher by the name of Silver, seeking the legendary Dragonhawk! That's a hawk, not a dragon. Common misunderstanding.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/4":"A birdwatcher and a scholar... did anyone pick a combat class? For ascending the deadly Blood Tower?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/5":"Me! I'm a cool elf who's also a dragon and also a knight. My name is Brightclaw and I have a cool sword and claws and also my mom is here!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/6":"Ahem... yes, I'm Brightclaw's mother, a simple elvish trader... who negotiated a pact with a demon.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/7":"My name is Supreme Warlock Grimblade.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/8":"I'm beginning to understand where Dell's imagination comes from...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/init":"With Eiland's blessing, I'll be your host for a new adventure! Now, let's set the stage: you stand before an imposing gate, decorated with the bones and blood of fallen adventurers.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/1":"It's because we're on a journey... of knowledge!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/2":"No, it's because I like making friends with all the cool monsters! They told me I'm half-elf, half-dragon, half-knight, and secretly half-unicorn!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/3":"You might be the most magical creature of them all, Brightclaw. But your ma is an elf, so was your pa some kind of... Dragon Unicorn Knight?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/4":"Fascinating question. I'll roll for scholarly insight and draconic knowledge... oh rats, a three. Well, let's inquire with Brightclaw's mother. Grimblade?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/5":"I suppose I can ask. Holt, are you a Dragon Unicorn Knight?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/6":"Whatever you say, honey!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/init":"Your ragtag group has traveled three floors up the Blood Tower, inexplicably befriending every monster along the way. In fact, I don't think you've fought... anyone?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/1":"Silver is overcome with awe. He approaches reverently and coos, in the manner described in Daffodilia's Guide to Birds Strange and Mundane.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/10":"Oh no, you're not getting out of a fight this time. In fact, this parade of buffoonery enrages the Dragonhawk. Illusion falls away, revealing the Dragonhawk's true identity.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/11":"Demonlord Blood, who built this tower. An architect. An EVIL architect.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/12":"Gasp! My enemy!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/2":"The ancient bird heaves a deep, reverberating sigh. \"Oh dear,\" it says. \"Another fan.\" ","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/3":"Wait what-","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/4":"Can I be friends with it? Can I pet it? I really want to pet it.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/5":"Honey, it's a creature of ancient wisdom and power.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/6":"Besides, you don't know where that legendary bird has been.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/7":"The Dragonhawk hears your insinuations about its hygiene and has judged you... unworthy of giving pets.

You made it angry!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/9":"Don't worry everyone, I'll enthrall this bird with the power of conversation.

Literally!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/14":"I learned how to make a pact with a demon!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/2":"Apparently he's never met someone who knew the contract better than him!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/3":"Think, guys! That big arch he's sitting on is Alda style. Mister Aram said it relies on a keystone, but I can't hit something so far away!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/4":"Silver can do it. He's so let down by the Dragonhawk, this is his origin story... this is how he becomes a DARK BIRDWATCHER. I activate Shadow Eye and shoot the keystone!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/5":"A class change in the middle of battle? I'll allow it. The keystone shatters!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/6":"Demonlord Blood falls to the ground, trapped by his awkward conversation with Supreme Grimblade, made even more awkward by his graceless tumble.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/7":"I roll to show Demonlord Blood the pages of my architectural digest, hoping to turn him from the ways of evil architecture.

More of that extra for me, please.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/6":"I want to wrap myself up in this drink like a blanket, it's so cozy! What is it?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/7":"Hot toddy. Hot water, lemon, honey, and a splash of whatever you like. Thought something simple after a complicated week was just the thing.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/8":"Maybe you're right. And you know, I think it's very important I quality control this drink.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/9":"That'd be mighty helpful of you.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/init":"Ohhh, I know that look, Adeline, you're thinking of going back to work! Keep your behind parked in that chair!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/1":"I'm overrun with mint this year! Hayden called it a bumper crop. I brought more, take it!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/2":"Nice, I can pretty up drinks with the fresh stuff. And... there we are, mint gimlets all around. Give them a go!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/3":"Oh! It's so cute! And green! And it tastes so minty! And herby!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/4":"And fresh! And limey!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/5":"Hemlock used to mix me one of these after a long, hot day in the Mines. Oh, happy days... no matter the time of year, this is the taste of summer!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/6":"It's so refreshing! This drink and I were mint to be together.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/7":"Thanks to Celine, I've got it bottled up behind the counter now, so come back for the taste of summer any time. You too, [Ari]!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/init":"Thanks for bringing all that mint by earlier this week, Celine. Reina cooked it down and got a nice syrup out of it, so we've got something special today.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/1":"I know you're a coffee fan, so I've been experimenting since last time I saw Darcy at the Market. Took weeks to get the flavor right!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/10":"Not even a pun? Now that's a first.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/2":"Now, we've got two to one of our base liquor and the coffee liqueur, over ice. That's a nice molasses color, isn't it?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/3":"It looks a bit... bitter. Unless...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/4":"You know it. Reina whipped up some sweet heavy cream for us. Now, a big, generous ladle on top...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/5":"Oh my gosh. It looks scrumptious!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/6":"You're an artist, Hemlock. Cheers!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/7":"Look at the cream blend with the coffee! It looks like a heavy mist over the mountains...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/8":"Now that's a pretty name. We'll call it a Heavy Mist! So, what do you think Holt?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/9":"Can't! Talk! Too... busy... drinking!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/init":"You absolute madman. You did it. Coffee liqueur!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/1":"This is something we used to make after a long day in the Mines. It went by many names! Rock Juice, the Mineshaft, Blood from the Stone, the Sinkhole...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/10":"Oh, you're all giving up in favor a normal drink? That's how we did it in the old days, too.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11":"What about you, [Ari]? You can have a beer, but someone's got to, ah, handle this Bucket Brew.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11/prompts/0":"Bucket Brew me!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11/prompts/1":"I'll stick with beer.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/12":"Hoho, you're an adventurous one! That's the spirit!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/13":"You've wisdom beyond your years, [Ari].","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/2":"Helmet Hash, Miner's Mash, Bucket Brew...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/3":"So what was the recipe?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/4":"Well, it wasn't a recipe so much as we all poured whatever dregs we had into a canteen and gave it a good shake!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/5":"Errol, as the one responsible for the wellbeing of this town, I have to ask. What was safer, the Mines or this drink?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/6":"Hah! You're quite a card, Lady Adeline.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/7":"He didn't answer the question, did he?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/8":"He sure didn't...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/9":"How about a round of beers instead?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/init":"Hemlock's been so generously mixing the drinks the past few weeks, I thought I'd share a recipe of my own!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/1":"I joined the drawing club because I want to start sketching my animals. They grow up so fast, you know?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/2":"Valen's the model this week! I thought she'd be quite stiff, but she actually seems very comfortable in her poses.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/3":"An understanding of muscle groups is a must in my line of work. Now, are you ready? Next pose!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/4":"Wait, I'm still drawing! I can't create a masterpiece under these conditions.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/5":"It's not about creating a masterpiece, March! It's about having fun and spending time with your big bro!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/6":"It's not about being the best at drawing?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/7":"I see. So it's about being the best at having fun and hanging out.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/init":"Welcome to the first drawing club session of the season, [Ari]! We've got all kinds of talents here.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/1":"Between you and me, my back seized up ten minutes ago and now I'm stuck like this.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/2":"I heard that, and I'll take a look when we're done here. But for now, why don't we peek at everyone's drawings?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/3":"I like Landen's! You can see his carpenter's hand in it. Is it all those years of technical drawing, Landen?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/4":"You got me, lady. In case you're wondering, a clean line is all in the shoulder. Which I can see you've taken to heart, March! Big improvement!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/5":"Th-thanks. I mean, it's only natural, right? And speaking of natural, Valen... your drawings are something else.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/6":"Oh, thank you March. I was just thinking that Elsie's portraits are so striking. She really draws out the... charm points of her subject.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/7":"Are my pecs really that big?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/8":"Did you do some drawing down on the farm, big guy? The baby animals in your sketchbook are WAY cute.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/9":"I wanted a memento from when they're tiny! These drawings are nothing special... not as special as I'd like. Now, can someone get some ice for my back?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/init":"I'm the model this week! You might be wondering how can I hold this pose for so long...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/1":"My drawings are pretty bad, but I'll try to do you justice, Elsie!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/2":"Hayden, if I could point something out. I noticed you've got a habit of putting your own drawings down.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/3":"You avoid sharing them, too... It's important to take pride in what you do.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/4":"Aaand?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/5":"And to have fun, too. I guess.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/6":"My goodness, March. As a doctor, I'm afraid I have to diagnose you with a growth... of character.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/7":"What you're all saying is tough medicine, but don't think I'm not taking it to heart! If even stubborn young March can change, then your ol' friend Hayden can too.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/8":"Yeah, exactly!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/9":"Hey, wait a minute...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/init":"I'm having such fun being this week's model, [Ari]! Between performing in the opera and walking the red carpet, I'm no stranger to striking a pose!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/1":"Thanks, I put a lot of work into my traps! Okay, I better make way for this week's real model.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/2":"Cluck cluck!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/3":"I like your attitude, young lady. And what a lovely pose... you're giving us so much wing!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/4":"How is Henrietta such a dynamic model?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/5":"Thanks for sharing this with us, Hayden. Seems awful special to you.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/6":"I've seen so many animals grow up since I took the farm over. Thought it might be nice to start sketching up some memories.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/7":"Before I knew it, I was sketching all by myself and got in my own head about it.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/8":"Thanks for talking some sense into me! You reminded me I'm the sharing type, and drawing's more fun with friends besides. Isn't that right, [Ari]?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/9":"GYA HA HA!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/init":"Excellent contrapposto, Olric!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_josephine/init":"Juniper and Terithia look thick as thieves up there on the balcony! What do you suppose they're talking about?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_luc/init":"Miss Terithia looks like a sailor when she leans over the balcony! It's like she's on a ship!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_maple/1":"Anyway, that's how I know Miss Juniper and Miss Terithia are both up on the balcony.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_maple/init":"I once asked Mama why Miss Juniper and Miss Terithia laugh like that, and Mama told me to shush and be polite.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/1":"Lords of the Land... Hm. Can't say I'm familiar with it.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/2":"It was locked in a chest, which was a bit odd. Anyway, all of the pieces were present and accounted for.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/3":"Do you suppose we could play it? It might open up a whole new avenue of research.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/4":"So we each pick a game piece to represent us on the board? Oh, I want the flower!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/5":"It's a daffodil, Mom. And really? That... that's my game piece! That's me!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/6":"I suppose I'll be the jester's cap.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/7":"Now Eiland, if there's a jester around these parts, it would be yours truly.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/8":"When was the last time you even cracked a joke?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/9":"Hm. Perhaps there was a reason this game was locked up...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/init":"I found an old board game in the museum archives! Look at this.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/1":"What's riveting is the fact that Eiland is buying up all this property and then sitting on it! Surely you can find a use for your empire?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/10":"I wonder if there's more to Lords of the Land than we think.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/2":"But I have, Nora! It's my duty to preserve these historical buildings. I'm leaving them intact.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/3":"But you had it all declared landmarks! No one has any place to live!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/4":"That's why Celine and I pooled our black market bucks to get around the law. You see, Eiland may have bought the buildings, but I bought the deeds to the land.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/5":"I'm going to level it to make room for my newest development... an amusement park!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/6":"Welcome... to Holtland.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/7":"You said we'd call it Celineland!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/8":"For a silly little board game, it certainly induces people to act unlike themselves.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/9":"It raises the collective blood pressure of the table, too...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/init":"This game is riveting, Eiland. You said it's called Lords of the Land?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/1":"Apparently this game is outlawed in seven countries, four provinces and two city-states. It has a storied history of turning neighbor against neighbor.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/10":"This has been simply fascinating. I wonder if I might take the game home with me?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/11":"I'd love to study it.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/2":"Of course, we live in more civilized times, so no need to let that ruin the fun!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/3":"Fun? FUN? You think the woodworker's district burning down in the last game was fun?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/4":"It only burned down because you were courting the reformed thieves guild in hopes of swindling them out of their property.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/5":"Instead, they came after you! For revenge!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/6":"We don't take kindly to being tricked, Dad. You should have taken the deal. It was an honest offer.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/7":"Actually, it was a bit outrageous as offers go... you overvalued that real estate at least twice over.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/8":"We're a reformed thieves guild, Eiland... not fools.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/9":"Do you take us for fools, Eiland?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/init":"I uncovered some interesting facts about Lords of the Land in the past week!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/1":"It's true! Reina really outdid herself. And Eiland, this tea is so lovely and floral! Thank you for sharing it with us.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/2":"Of course! Good things are meant to be shared.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/3":"Weren't we playing a board game, though?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/4":"That's right! Lords of the Land. Didn't Valen take it home last time?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/5":"I threw it in the river.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/6":"You threw a historical artifact... in the river?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/7":"It seemed the best place for it. And look at us! We're all getting along quite nicely.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/8":"But Valen... what happens when it washes up in the next town over?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/9":"It'll tear that village apart!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/init":"These shortcakes are delicious, Celine.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/1":"Now, let's introduce our first book! Terithia picked Tales of the Sea, a collection of fishy folktales. Tell me about your favorite story!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/2":"I quite liked the Ballad of the Sea Cucumber. For a story with such an adorable premise, the sense of melancholy at the close is what made it stick out in my mind.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/3":"Oh yeah, I liked that one. My favorite was the one about the three pirates. I had no idea who was going to end up captain in the end!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/4":"To be frank, I've been on ships like that.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/5":"KYA HA HA!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/6":"I was partial to the Siren's Song story! I could relate, I'm not immune to a charming face and a pretty ditty!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/7":"You'd walk right into the ocean, I suspect.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/8":"Lucky for me I'm such a strong swimmer!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/init":"Oh, it is so exciting to welcome you to book club! I ran one in the Capital, too... I find discussion helps stimulate my mind as I formulate my memoirs!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/1":"I've been dying to talk about this book all week! I started reading right after our last session, and I couldn't put it down! The twists! The turns!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/2":"I love a closed room mystery, and setting it on a ship was so cool.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/3":"When they said the first murder happened on the deck, where it was impossible to hide... I was captivated. I started keeping a journal!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/4":"Then Ryis and I got to talking about it, and we started pinning notes to the wall in my room. I woke up and went to sleep staring at that thing!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/5":"I was a man possessed! I couldn't figure it out!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/6":"The writer also had all the little nautical details down pat. The absentee pennant, the fake murder weapon hidden in the bilge, the landlubber knots being a clue...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/7":"It was very convincing!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/8":"And who would have thought the butler was the murderer? Not me! But it all made sense...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/init":"Oh, I can't wait! Let's get this book club started! What did you think of Murder on the Grand Leviathan?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/1":"Yes... unique... rarely have I seen a book written with such, ah... deliberate precision.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/2":"But the diagrams! Illustrations were a welcome addition.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/3":"I thought the author's note at the end was rather romantic. In his heart, he dedicated that building to his wife.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/4":"Even if he was rather dry about it.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/5":"See, Ryis? What'd I tell you? We spent a whole summer bonding over that book, and now they're appreciating it too!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/6":"Uncle, it's a technical manual for reconstructing a wooden cathedral... I don't think this is the kind of book Elsie was talking about. Sorry guys, I tried to talk him out of it.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/7":"I did enjoy rereading it, though...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/init":"So, ah... Landen and Ryis' choice of book was a bit unique, don't ya think?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/1":"The Rise and Fall of House Amore. What a story!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/10":"Would it be too forward to ask for mine to be signed?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/2":"I'll say! This is what book club is all about! Though I don't know how I feel about Ryis reading about all that.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/3":"What are you even talking about? It was hardly lurid.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/4":"Listen to you! In my day that chapter twelve hand-holding scene would have meant a content warning on the cover!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/5":"Anyway! I love a good love triangle. And this one was so good. I really didn't know which way the princess would go!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/6":"The maelstrom of feelings I had at the end!

It's got... character. And it's my gift to you, Nora!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/1":"Me either. I asked Eiland to look up the artist, and it turns out she did almost three hundred portraits during her life, mostly for nobility.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/10":"That's... very mysterious.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/11":"You don't suppose that this clown is... an immortal creature of the night?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/2":"There's something about the subject... underneath all the clown makeup, he almost seems familiar.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/3":"I was thinking the same thing... odd, that.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/4":"That's quite unlikely.

After the detective club's observations last week, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this painting.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/1":"I dug further into the artist, and though she did many portraits, she did most of them for three noble families: The Wainscotts, The Meridians, and The Hawthornes.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/2":"I'm familiar with all those names, though the Wainscott name ended when the last daughter of the line married into another house.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/3":"\"If revealed, 'twould gain naught but scorn.

You see their faces on campaign posters a few times a year!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/6":"That explains why the clown looks so familiar! I think we're onto something!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/7":"I'll contact the family to verify the truth. If we return the painting, perhaps we'll get a nice reward for reuniting them with a beloved heirloom!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/8":"One question remains, though... why a clown?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/init":"This painting is mesmerizing me. There's something about the clown's eyes. Like he's torn between two worlds.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/1":"The good news is that we solved the mystery! This painting was indeed commissioned by the late Lord Hawthorne.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/10":"All yours, [Ari]. This clown was giving me nightmares.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/11":"Great. Let's bury it somewhere... funny. I think Hawthorne would have liked that.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/12":"A mystery well-solved, everyone!

I suppose his descendants want nothing to do with their clownish history...","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/7":"So... what do we do with it?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/8":"Well, the Hawthornes said it was a political liability. They want it destroyed.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9":"I don't have the heart to do that, but maybe we can bury it. I'll get a shovel.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9/prompts/0":"Wait!

You watch helplessly as your quarry disappears into the crowd beyond.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/10":"His disorientation is an advantage for my spell of truth! I weave it around him before he has a chance to get his thoughts in order.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/11":"Goldwolf would like to point out that truth is better extracted with a potion than a spell.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/12":"Anelace would like to point out that she doesn't tell Goldwolf how to throw heavy objects.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/13":"The truth comes out slowly, carefully, as though the man is piecing it together himself.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/14":"Penelope Lovestruck was a spy for the crown, and this man is Hans, her handler! If she's missing, it means something's gone terribly wrong.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/15":"Hans wants to recruit you to a clandestine effort to get Penelope back...

That was our best lead!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/3":"Goldwolf thinks you give up too easily.

Get 'im!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/7":"I'm on it!

I roll to throw it at him!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/9":"Your roll isn't high, but this is so delightful I'll allow it. The mighty melon sends the man prone.

She fell in love with the agent of a rival nation, and fled because her handler, Hans, branded her a traitor.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/10":"The spell wipes the man's mind! Penelope and her love abscond into the night, to start their new life.... At least until she's bored again.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/11":"And it's all thanks to you warriors of the heart!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/12":"Wonderful, wonderful!

Wait, what?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/16":"Somehow, Goldwolf is not surprised.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/2":"In fact, Penelope seems quite repentant. And torn. She loved Chip Rosewood's reliable experience, and adored Anelace's boundless curiosity.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/3":"She was fascinated by Goldwolf's stories of her barbarian homeland, and she was enthralled by the strength of Rocky's brain.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/4":"Sigh... she always was a sweetheart, that Penelope. Well, folks... I think we know what we have to do.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/5":"Goldwolf hates betrayal... but loves the juicy drama of forbidden love. Goldwolf votes to keep Hans at bay, so Penny and her newest flame can escape.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/6":"I use my powerful brain to headbutt the bad guy, so Anelace has time to cast a cool spell!","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/7":"The precepts of my magical school demand that I help anyone in need. I weave a spell of memory obliteration on the spy handler.","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/8":"Unless Goldwolf objects?","Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/9":"Oh, no.

Can you make me a new axle for my wagon?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Balor_Nora/big_ruby/big_ruby/1":"It was a ruby, back in the Capital.

The Market's totally coming back!","Conversations/Group Conversations/Balor_Olric/saturday_no_market/saturday_no_market/init":"I came out to Mistria for the Saturday Market, among other reasons.

I should probably ask!","Conversations/Group Conversations/Celine_Juniper/floral_aid/floral_aid_1/init":"Hi, [Ari]! I'm helping Juniper forage some rare flowers for one of her potions.

What do you think?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_March/walls/walls/1":"Yes. It might be illuminating to look into the history of their construction...","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_March/walls/walls/init":"The walls look good, Eiland. And they held up pretty well during the earthquake, didn't they?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_March/walls/walls_2/1":"Hm. Nothing urgent, but I'll ask Olric to come out and take a look when he has time.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_March/walls/walls_2/init":"A flaw? Is it serious?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/eiland_piano/1":"The tension... yeah... bro, my head hurts.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/eiland_piano/init":"Try to memorize how I finger the keys, Olric. Observe how I alternate the notes, increasing the tension of the piece!","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/olric_piano/1":"Yeah, bro! You just gotta feel the music... let it flow through you...","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/olric_piano/2":"Let it flow... yes... I'm feeling it! The ancient, storied call of music!","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/olric_piano/init":"Olric, this is lovely playing. You say you're self-taught? And you don't even use sheet music?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/piano/1":"I didn't know I liked mining until I started, and so I got to thinking... what else would I like if I tried it?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/piano/2":"Life is about the journey, you know?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/piano/init":"Why the sudden interest in learning piano, Olric?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Olric/piano/piano_2/1":"Aw, thanks boss!

Maybe with some nice inlay on the doors, and a way to keep them temperature controlled.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Ryis/icebox/icebox/2":"I think you're looking for an icebox, Eiland.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Ryis/icebox/icebox/init":"So let me get this straight... you want a bookshelf, but for cakes?","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Valen/alda/alda/1":"It was worth a shot. Thanks for your time, Valen!","Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Valen/alda/alda/init":"Medical practices during the Alda era? I'm not sure my family's notes go back that far.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Elsie_Errol/chicken_scratch/chicken_scratch/1":"Erm, yes please. Lord Eiland seems to have a bit of difficulty deciphering my... what did he call it... chicken's scratch.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Elsie_Errol/chicken_scratch/chicken_scratch/init":"You want me to help you practice your handwriting, Errol? I suppose I could remember a few lessons from finishing school.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Elsie_Hayden/romance/romance/1":"My my!

While I appreciate a good bathhouse, I'm not sure I can see getting myself into the business.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Elsie_Juniper/running_a_bathhouse/running_a_bathhouse_2/2":"Ah, r-right. That's a shame.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Elsie_Juniper/running_a_bathhouse/running_a_bathhouse_2/init":"In the circles I run in, you could become a powerful woman, Elsie.","Conversations/Group Conversations/Elsie_Juniper/saturday_no_market/saturday_no_market/1":"I think you'd do just fine in high society as you are, my dear. But perhaps you can show me where you got those boots!","Conversations/Group Conversations/Elsie_Juniper/saturday_no_market/saturday_no_market/init":"It's too bad about the Market being closed.

Remarkable!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/12":"And... yes. More writing.

You've got a talent for archaeology, [Ari].","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/4":"Anything we find here could have immense archaeological value! Let's keep our eyes open.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/5":"The writing you uncovered at the stele was illuminating.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/6":"It implies that the people who hid the Dragonsworn armor believed that its ability to defend wasn't just in wearing the armor itself.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/7":"They thought that a single piece of the armor could protect an entire area.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/8":"Which makes me believe that the Western Ruins are a good candidate for uncovering more pieces!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/9":"So are you ready to roll up your sleeves and begin the hunt? It's a big site to cover!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/init":"[Ari]! Welcome, welcome. Take it all in, isn't it magnificent?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts_follow_up_1/init":"The Dragonsworn's helmet! At our museum! I'm besides myself. Thank you so much, [Ari]!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/1":"Haha... about that...","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/10":"It's hardly an adventure, but can I count on you to help me search?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/10/prompts/0":"I'm in! What are friends for?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/10/prompts/1":"Maybe we'll leave today's adventure out of the history books...","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/11":"Thank you, [Ari]!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/12":"Haha... I was thinking the same thing.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/13":"Now as you might imagine, I've already done a thorough job of combing through my own rooms. So we'll start with my sister's office.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/14":"Hey, you two!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/15":"Let me guess, you heard I was consolidating old council minutes and want in on the action?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/16":"Don't feel bad saying no. I'm just keeping Adeline company.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/17":"[Ari] and I are on an important mission, hunting for the cloak of the Dragonsworn.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/18":"I believe it may be somewhere in this very building!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/19":"Oh my, how exciting!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/2":"Haha, well... in a sense?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/20":"Well feel free to search my office, but I don't think that I've seen anything like that here.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/21":"I suppose I should conduct a search of my own room then.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/22":"Oh, I'd be happy to help-","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/23":"Let's leave your auntie some privacy, eh?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/24":"This takes me back. It's a bit like the signet ring all over again, isn't it?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/25":"When we were kids, Eiland found an old ring down in the basement.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/26":"He liked it so much he and Mother did a bunch of research to find out whose crest was on it.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/27":"It turned out to be the signet ring of a very, very old Caldosian dynasty, long thought lost.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/28":"Well Mother was so proud, she had it sent off to the Capital to be verified, and then the Caldosians got word of it...","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/28/prompts/0":"The Caldosians must have been thrilled!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/28/prompts/1":"Let me guess, you didn't get your ring back?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/29":"It ended up being a bit of an international incident, actually.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/3":"After translating the text and putting the clues together, I have become convinced that the next piece of the armor is...","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/30":"It would have ended up in a museum regardless, but no.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/31":"Well, it certainly gave you your taste for archaeology at any rate.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/32":"And the Caldosians got their ring back eventually. I even got an official thank you letter from their Emperor.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/33":"Fooooound it!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/34":"Aunt Elsie, perhaps you should let a certified archaeologist check first-","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/35":"It really IS the Dragonsworn Cloak! It certainly doesn't look that ancient, does it?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/36":"Wherever did you find it?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/37":"In my wardrobe. When I moved in I just shoved everything still in there as far back as it would go.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/38":"Can you believe it, [Ari]? The third piece of the Dragonsworn Armor! Were there any notes with it? A storage box?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/39":"Oh no, it was folded up among a pile of old blankets.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/4":"In this very house.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/40":"I was afraid of this.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/41":"With no clues, it will make the next piece that much harder to find.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/42":"Maybe it's recorded somewhere in the annals of the house? Those go back hundreds of years.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/43":"I think that might be our best bet.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/44":"Let's hope our quest doesn't end here, [Ari].","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/44/prompts/0":"We won't stop till we complete the armor!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/44/prompts/1":"Three out of however many ain't bad!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/45":"You're right! This is just another challenge to overcome.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/46":"It's true, what we've recovered so far is amazing.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/47":"Whatever comes next, I say it's high time to celebrate what you two have achieved.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/48":"And you!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/49":"Just so! I'm going to get a bottle of that very old wine from down cellar.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/5":"I believe we are looking for the Dragonsworn Cloak, a truly excellent example of \"Dynweaving\" that imparted the cloth with incredible durability.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/50":"Cheers everyone!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/6":"Legends say it could turn aside swords, and even arrows couldn't pierce it.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/7":"However, at some point the cloak became a symbol of the leader of Mistria. As fashion sensibilities changed, well...","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/8":"Frankly, I think it ended up tucked away in some odd corner of the house.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/9":"Luckily for us, nothing ever gets thrown away around here.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/init":"Thank you for coming, [Ari].","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/init/prompts/0":"Where are we off to? Ancient ruins? A forgotten temple?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/init/prompts/1":"Let me guess, you found a secret labyrinth in the Manor!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/1":"Magnificent, isn't it? It's very old, certainly older than the town around it. You can find steles like this all over the country, although ours is in particularly good shape.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/1/prompts/0":"Stele?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/1/prompts/1":"Do you think it marks where treasure is buried?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/10":"A hidden compartment?! Don't tell me-","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/11":"Incredible, they're a perfect match for the ones on the stele! The Dragonsworn's Greaves! Here this whole time!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/12":"And look inside the hidden compartment, there's more writing!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/13":"This will take time to translate... Can you hand me the greaves, [Ari]?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/14":"Thank you. Now to get these to the museum!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/2":"An ancient monument. They were put up for all sorts of reasons. Memorials, to mark boundaries, or to commemorate great events.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/3":"Wouldn't that be nice! However, people who hide treasure usually don't mark it so obviously.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/4":"Our stele depicts a legendary set of armor, worn by someone called the Dragonsworn. It's quite unique!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/5":"Supposedly the Dragonsworn was a nearly mythical being who aided the dragons in the ancient days of the world. Could you imagine!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/5/prompts/0":"Y-you don't say!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/5/prompts/1":"Haha, d-do you think they're still around?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/6":"Of course, legends do tend to be full of, well, legendary figures. The truth of the matter has been lost.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/7":"Very funny! I'd settle just for finding their armor!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/8":"Although the armor and the details around the Dragonsworn have been lost to us, thanks to this stele, we do have some clues. Come here!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/9":"If you place your hands along the surface of the stele, you should still be able to feel raised lettering that's undetectable at first glance.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/init":"[Ari], welcome! Come on, it's this way.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_1/1":"I'll let you know as soon as I'm done translating the new text. Could you imagine if it led us to another piece of the armor?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_1/init":"I don't know if the earthquake dislodged something from the mechanism in the stele, or if it was just luck, but I can't thank you enough.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_2/init":"[Ari]! Would you look at you! A find like a piece of the Dragonsworn's Armor set is every archaeologist's dream!","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Elsie/elsie_two_hearts/elsie_two_hearts/1":"So? What do you think of my memoirs?","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Elsie/elsie_two_hearts/elsie_two_hearts/10":"I was always better at applying the lessons rather than learning the theory, if you take my meaning.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Elsie/elsie_two_hearts/elsie_two_hearts/11":"Thank you, [Ari]... this has been illuminating.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Elsie/elsie_two_hearts/elsie_two_hearts/12":"While I do feel accomplished, seeing my life on the page like this makes it feel a bit... sparse.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Elsie/elsie_two_hearts/elsie_two_hearts/12/prompts/0":"This draft is four hundred pages...","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Elsie/elsie_two_hearts/elsie_two_hearts/12/prompts/1":"It seems like you have a lot of adventures ahead of you.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Elsie/elsie_two_hearts/elsie_two_hearts/13":"I know, I know...

I'll just have a seltzer water.","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Stillwell/stillwell_two_hearts/stillwell_two_hearts/16":"Nicely done. After a Ditchwater cocktail, Juniper would have returned to the bathhouse and accidentally added an extra ingredient to the bath salts...","Cutscenes/Heart Events/Stillwell/stillwell_two_hearts/stillwell_two_hearts/17":"Which would end up permanently turning everyone in town blue.

It's a lovely spot, quite close to town.","Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/6":"I'll walk with you the rest of the way, if you don't mind the company.
